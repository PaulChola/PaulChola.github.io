  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I’m someone who’s driven by curiosity and a deep desire to understand how things work.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s funny how it all started. I remember it vividly — I must have been 18 or 19 at the time. Back then, I knew nothing about cyberspace. I was just curious, searching for tools to “hack systems” without really understanding what any of it meant. The first tools I ever downloaded were Metasploit and Nmap — on my phone. I had to transfer them to my laptop just to install them.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I first installed Linux, I remember showing off to my friends. In reality, I was mostly watching movies on it. I had a powerful hacking operating system, but I didn’t really understand how it worked or how to use it. I didn’t know what ports were, or flags — I was just clicking through graphical interfaces, trying to make sense of things. That was around 2015.
  </p>

  <p>
    By 2018, I had already killed three hard drives trying to install Kali Linux. Funny times.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even today, I’m still learning how everything works — and that’s the part I enjoy the most. The difference now is clarity. Back then, it was pure curiosity. Now, I understand what these tools are capable of, how systems behave, and how to approach problems with purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    Almost ten years later, things are finally starting to make sense. I learn every day, build projects, deploy what I create, and contribute wherever I can. I’d rather spend my time online learning and creating than just consuming content. For me, this journey isn’t just about cybersecurity or technology — it’s about growth, curiosity, and becoming better with every step.
  </p>

  <p><em>
    This portfolio is a reflection of that journey — from curiosity to understanding, from experimentation to purpose.
